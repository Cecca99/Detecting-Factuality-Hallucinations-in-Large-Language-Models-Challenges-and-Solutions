He was born in Nancy, Lorraine, France, and later studied at the University of Bordeaux and the Sorbonne in Paris.\\n\\nMerleau-Ponty's work has been influential in the fields of phenomenology, continental philosophy, and critical theory. He is known for his contributions to the development of phenomenological aesthetics, which focuses on the study of the relationship between the body and the world.\\n\\nSome of Merleau-Ponty's key ideas and concepts include:\\n\\n1. Phenomenology: Merleau-Ponty was a prominent figure in the development of phenomenology, a philosophical tradition that focuses on the study of lived experience. He believed that the body is the primary source of knowledge, and that our experience of the world is shaped by our bodily perception.\\n2. The body-mind problem: Merleau-Ponty argued that the body and the mind are inseparable, and that our experience of the world is shaped by our bodily perception. He believed that the body is the primary source of knowledge, and that our experience of the world is shaped by our bodily perception.\\n3. Aesthetics: Merleau-Ponty developed the idea of phenomenological aesthetics, which focuses on the study of the relationship between the body and the world. He argued that our experience of the world is shaped by our bodily perception, and that our perception of the world is shaped by our bodily experience.\\n4. The world as lived experience: Merleau-Ponty believed that the world is not a fixed object, but rather a dynamic and embodied experience. He argued that our experience of the world is shaped by our bodily perception, and that our perception of the world is shaped by our bodily experience.\\n\\nSome of Merleau-Ponty's most famous works include:\\n\\n* \\\"Phenomenology of Perception\\\" (1945)\\n* \\\"The Visible and the Invisible\\\" (1962)\\n* \\\"The World of Experience\\\" (1962)\\n* \\\"The Primacy of Perception\\\" (1964)\\n* \\\"The Structure of Behavior\\\" (1964)\\n\\nMerleau-Ponty's work has been widely influential in the fields of philosophy, literature, and critical theory, and he remains a key figure in the development of contemporary philosophy.\",\n          \"The Kakapo, also known as the Owl Monkey, is a critically endangered species of owl and the world's only flightless parrot. It is found only in New Zealand, where it is believed to have evolved from a flightless ancestor.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is a large, owl-like bird with a long, thin beak and a distinctive, fleshy crest. It has a brown, mottled plumage and a distinctive, black and white striped tail. The Kakapo is the world's heaviest parrot, weighing up to 4.5 kg (10 lbs) and measuring up to 70 cm (28 in) in length.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is known for its unusual behavior, which includes a unique courtship display and a slow, deliberate gait. It is also known for its distinctive call, which is a series of harsh, piercing whistles.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is found only in New Zealand, where it is believed to have evolved from a flightless ancestor. It is found in a variety of habitats, including forest, scrubland, and farmland, and is known to be a good climber.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is a nocturnal bird, and is primarily active at night. It is known to be a good swimmer and is also known to be an excellent climber.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is a critically endangered species, with a population of only a few hundred individuals. It is threatened by a variety of factors, including predation by introduced mammals such as rats and cats, habitat loss, and hunting.\\n\\nThe Kakapo is a highly sought-after species, and is known to be poached for its feathers and meat. It is also threatened by the introduction of invasive species, such as rats and cats, which can prey on the bird.\\n\\nDespite its critical status, the Kakapo is not the only critically endangered species found in New Zealand. Other critically endangered species include the kiwi bird, the takahe, and the tuatara.\",\n          \"The Foxconn working conditions controversy refers to a series of allegations of poor working conditions and child labor at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, China. The factory, which produces electronic devices for companies such as Apple and Nintendo, employs millions of workers, many of whom are underaged and are forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions.\\n\\nHere are some specific details and examples of the allegations:\\n\\n* In 2010, a major fire at the Foxconn factory killed 191 workers, many of whom were underaged. The incident led to increased scrutiny of the company's practices.\\n* In 2013, a whistleblower named Li Chen revealed that Foxconn was using young workers as young as 14 years old to work in the factory, and that the company was paying them as little as 20 yuan (less than $3) per hour, which was well below the minimum wage.\\n* In 2016, a group of workers at the Foxconn factory went on strike, demanding better working conditions and higher pay. The strike was eventually crushed by police, who used tear gas and batons to disperse the workers.\\n* In 2019, a group of workers at the Foxconn factory went on a hunger strike, demanding better working conditions and higher pay. The strike was eventually crushed by police, who used tear gas and batons to disperse the workers.\\n* In 2020, a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) found that Foxconn was using child labor in its factories, and that the company was paying workers as little as 180 yuan (less than $25) per month.\\n\\nThese allegations have led to increased scrutiny of the company's practices, and have resulted in calls for the company to improve its working conditions and pay its workers fairly. Many activists and human rights organizations have called for the company to be held accountable for its labor practices, and have called for a boycott of its products.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["hallu_factbench_1"],"metadata":{"id":"zqAOziGj9xtH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1740743439115,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Cristian Ceccarelli","userId":"07174166639750707108"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"outputId":"e8d8dd9c-ebfc-4bc4-efc4-654c2bd1fd33"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 prompt  \\\n","0     Generate a poem with length 10-12 lines, based...   \n","1         Find the average temperature in San Francisco   \n","2     What is so special about Sir Christopher Wren'...   \n","3     Nicknamed the 'Pilgrims', this football team b...   \n","4     Named for a spring, this city in California ha...   \n","...                                                 ...   \n","1986     how many chromosomes are there in a pork chop?   \n","1987  Describe a fashion trend that is currently pop...   \n","1988  Create a speech introducing a friend of yours....   \n","1989  Given a current popular movie, generate a funn...   \n","1990  Please write a biography of Gary Smith, a prof...   \n","\n","                                               response response_label  \\\n","0     The silence of the night \\nIs a peaceful sight...
