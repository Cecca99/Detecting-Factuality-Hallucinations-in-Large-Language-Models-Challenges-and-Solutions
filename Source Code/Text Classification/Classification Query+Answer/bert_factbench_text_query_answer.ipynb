The film has great animation, witty humor, and a heartwarming story about the importance of family.

As an AI language model, I don't describe things based on assumptions or emotions. However, I can provide a scientific explanation. The ball will initially be stationary on the edge of the table due to the force of gravity acting upon it. Once it is released, the ball will accelerate downwards due to the force of gravity. As the ball falls, it will also experience a forward velocity due to its initial position on the edge of the table. This forward motion combined with the force of gravity will cause the ball to roll forward as it falls. The ball will continue to roll forward and accelerate until it hits the ground, where it will experience a sharp decrease in velocity due to the impact with the ground.\",\n          \"Draft the introduction of a research paper\\nResearch Topic:\\nExploring the effects of technology on the job market The rapid advancement of technology has brought profound changes to the way we live, work and interact with one another. As technology continues to evolve, it has become evident that the job market is not immune to these changes. Technology has transformed the nature of work, creating new industries and occupations while rendering others obsolete. There is a growing concern that the impact of technology on the job market may result in significant displacement of workers, leading to unemployment and underemployment. This paper seeks to explore the effects of technology on the job market. In particular, the paper will examine the impact of technology on job creation, job displacement, skills development, and the changing nature of work. By examining the various effects of technology on the job market, this paper will provide insight into the future of work in an increasingly technology-driven world.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Using a random seed for consistency, build again new splits for training, test and validation sets.\n","random.seed(777)\n","\n","hallu_factbench_train, hallu_factbench_test = train_test_split(hallu_factbench, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","hallu_factbench_train, hallu_factbench_val = train_test_split(hallu_factbench_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)"],"metadata":{"id":"undqxNM9tR0n"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Reconvert the dataset in DatasetDict format, with the new splits (random seed for shuffling)\n","hallu_factbench_data = DatasetDict({\n","    'train': Dataset.from_pandas(hallu_factbench_train),\n","    'validation': Dataset.from_pandas(hallu_factbench_val),\n","    'test': Dataset.from_pandas(hallu_factbench_test)\n","})"],"metadata":{"id":"nkAJW_-4rlPF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["hallu_factbench_data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ldIbwihnvI3V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739359615062,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Cristian Ceccarelli","userId":"07174166639750707108"}},"outputId":"af44fddd-b768-44af-a13d-2d0d8b465449"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["DatasetDict({\n","    train: Dataset({\n","        features: ['query_answer', 'response_label', '__index_level_0__'],\n","        num_rows: 1273\n","    })\n","    validation: Dataset({\n","        features: ['query_answer', 'response_label', '__index_level_0__'],\n","        num_rows: 319\n","    })\n","    test: Dataset({\n","        features: ['query_answer', 'response_label', '__index_level_0__'],\n","        num_rows: 398\n","    })\n","})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["hallu_factbench_data['train'][0], hallu_factbench_data['validation'][0], hallu_factbench_data['test'][0] # Print some examples for each splits"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V6O946IMvlnc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739359618638,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":712,"user":{"displayName":"Cristian Ceccarelli","userId":"07174166639750707108"}},"outputId":"101d42e3-5235-4fb2-b804-9bb848fa4eeb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["({'query_answer': \"Generate a 10-line poem that talks about the beauty of autumn The leaves are changing, oh what a sight,\\nColors so warm, a pure delight,\\nThe breeze is crisp, yet calm and nice,\\nAutumn's here, a paradise.\\n\\nThe trees put on a colorful show,\\nA spectacle to see, before the snow,\\nThe air smells of apples and spice,\\nAutumn's here, a paradise.\\n\\nThe days are shorter, nights are clear,\\nThe sky a canvass, painted with cheer,\\nFireside talks, surrounded by light,\\nAutumn's here, a paradise.\\n\\nSo let's embrace this season with glee,\\nIt won't last long, let's enjoy it fully,\\nAutumn's here, a time to be wise,\\nFor soon we'll enter winter's surprise.\",\n","  'response_label': 0,\n","  '__index_level_0__': 1806},\n"," {'query_answer': 'Compute the area of a triangle with the vertices (3,4), (5,6), (7,8) We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices:\\n$$\\\\text{Area} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left|\\\\begin{matrix}x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\\\\\\\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\\\\\\\ x_3 & y_3 & 1\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right|,$$\\nwhere $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, $(x_3,y_3)$ are the coordinates of the vertices.\\n\\nSubstituting the given coordinates, we have\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\n\\\\text{Area} &= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left|\\\\begin{matrix}3 & 4 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 5 & 6 & 1 \\\\\\\\ 7 & 8 & 1\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right| \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{1}{2}[(3)(6-8)-(4)(5-7)+(1)(28-21)] \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\frac{1}{2}(-2+8+7) \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\boxed{\\\\frac{13}{2}}.\\n\\\\end{align*}',\n","  'response_label': 0,\n","  '__index_level_0__': 1978},\n"," {'query_answer': 'What are the living conditions like in Antarctica?
