Despite the challenges, many scientists and support staff enjoy living in Antarctica as they have the unique opportunity to explore one of the most remote and beautiful places on Earth.',\n","  'response_label': 1,\n","  '__index_level_0__': 887})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rxIvBqO8jYCo"},"source":["## **Load the model (GPT2)**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1526,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739354683144,"user":{"displayName":"Cristian Ceccarelli","userId":"07174166639750707108"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"4wwkhRskh9fZ","outputId":"cc2edc97-a4e8-4abd-ca37-b4d239e499a8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Some weights of GPT2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at openai-community/gpt2 and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]}],"source":["# Fix the number of labels\n","num_labels = len(set(hallu_factbench_data['train']['response_label']))\n","\n","# Retrieve the model and the corresponding tokenizer from HuggingFace with the method AutoModelForSequenceClassification, to add a classification head at the end of the model,\n","# in order to perform binary classification using the textual representations generated with the model\n","\n","model_id = \"openai-community/gpt2\"\n","\n","model =AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n","    model_id\n",")\n","\n","tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\n","\n","# Setting the pad token as the end of sentence token\n","\n","tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token\n","model.config.pad_token_id = model.config.eos_token_id"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u9_89u0kqKjK"},"source":["## **Preprocessing**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Preprocessing phase of the response that has to be evaluated as factual or hallucinated."],"metadata":{"id":"vmuGw2twQGdm"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":113,"referenced_widgets":["1021dc40d8284db587fbc61cfe02cb18","55f76beed15745ae8210d00bdc5a8923","4927b268e21c4b9abaab65e283a7aa26","992a2cc1de54462093cfc2b16c771101","c616fedafd314877b2e82d66bc5f5812","11bf544a928d4c40898161b2ce174003","a3c59f67e8ed4f418facad580cfd7787","2b77b62ab5374b9ebcac56e0b60ecfd6","fb5926a0cc7947ae9319eb5728d44710","9cf0aaa341e443b4bc849920b7303873","3e93ae4ea276405cbb805b03528c71e6","ccb4bb487abf4ef1a9dd2888bc2ee14c","10ca9bc72d3c41eba6110ce582a400ad","32cba8214a3f4fd3be40d2adc60c9b9a","62286b10c2214336b626ebc29657c3cd","ae433caa383d4570af21be556fcd9356","ab9d81bd18e540eaad614e2b281af58b","173b3bc43b6b4f5096dc42aea7f4010e","a3cbfbd02d00458faccab4fec829649a","68c93e1760a54bf5afc4cb8764678b4d","a8652ee9d7b441ed98d9f559c844512e","e304a8c7c87d490cb43f763c8bfcd7f5","774babe115104f149aa7b684bde32422","3f06035ae2094aa3a23933e24997daab","cfee03663a3844b891f2ad2bc2060a20","8a0df60363364067b8f5045db5b5d0ab","3b80c7dc31f14876a7744375b6b6e9d2","4156c4e2db664780924c880083149fa9","37a78b0119f04c398b0e623eed8b8aa5","47f2eb95ffe84d8f99ef51e266596920","1517426bb5084441a3bdbf3dec326d52","40e1b9e2d91b49c2b046906e637e3110","dafd22eabe9b4cfcab4e3bbcb25e397f"]},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1080,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739354692754,"user":{"displayName":"Cristian Ceccarelli","userId":"07174166639750707108"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"ihdorvdaiYfR","outputId":"d0d747fd-f339-4fe4-b913-c6a2bf44e405"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Map:   0%|          | 0/1273 [00:00<?, ?
